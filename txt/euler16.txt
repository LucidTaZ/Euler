Sum for i = 0 to inf:
  floor((2^N % 10^(i+1)) / 10^i)

= Sum for i = 0 to inf:
  floor((2^N % 10^(i+1)) / (10^i % 10^(i+1)))

= Sum for i = 0 to ceil(Log10(2^N)):
  floor(2^N/10^i % 10)

Final answer: 1366 as given by WolframAlpha with input:
sum floor(2^1000 / 10^j mod 10), j = 0 to ceil(Log10(2^1000))
